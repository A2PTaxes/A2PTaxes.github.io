    <h1>Officiant Services</h1>
    <p>Life is full of moments that deserve to be honored with intention, warmth, and respect. I offer officiant services for weddings, funerals, baby blessings, and other meaningful ceremonies throughout Oregon. My approach is inclusive, culturally sensitive, and centered on the values and stories that matter most to you.</p>

    <h2>Weddings & Commitment Ceremonies</h2>
    <p>Whether you’re planning a simple elopement or a full ceremony with family and friends, I work with you to create a script that reflects your relationship, your values, and your vision for the day.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Custom ceremony script tailored to your story</li>
      <li>Support with vows (written or guided)</li>
      <li>Rehearsal attendance available</li>
      <li>Legal filing of marriage license</li>
      <li>Inclusive of all genders, orientations, and traditions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Funerals & Celebration of Life</h2>
    <p>Honoring a loved one is a deeply personal experience. I offer gentle, compassionate officiating that centers the life, values, and legacy of the person you’re remembering.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collaborative story gathering with family</li>
      <li>Custom-written eulogy or shared‑voice ceremony</li>
      <li>Support for multi‑speaker services</li>
      <li>Respectful handling of cultural or spiritual preferences</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Baby Blessings & Naming Ceremonies</h2>
    <p>Welcoming a new child into your family or community is a joyful milestone. I create ceremonies that honor your traditions, values, and hopes for your child’s future.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Custom blessing or naming script</li>
      <li>Family participation options</li>
      <li>Secular, spiritual, or mixed‑tradition ceremonies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Other Life Ceremonies</h2>
    <p>Some moments don’t fit neatly into a category — and they still deserve to be honored. I also offer officiating for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Renewal of vows</li>
      <li>Milestone birthdays</li>
      <li>Gender affirmation ceremonies</li>
      <li>House blessings</li>
      <li>Retirement celebrations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>Every ceremony is crafted with care, respect, and emotional intelligence. I take time to understand your story, your values, and the tone you want — whether that’s joyful, solemn, humorous, or deeply heartfelt.</p>
    <p>I welcome families and individuals of all backgrounds, identities, faiths, and processing styles. Accommodations are always available.</p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>If you’re interested in officiant services, the best place to start is a short conversation about your needs, your timeline, and your vision for the ceremony.</p>
