    <h1>About Samantha Ames</h1>

    <p>Hi, I’m Samantha — an Oregon Licensed Tax Consultant, educator, creative strategist, and the owner of Ames 2 Please Taxes. My mission is simple: to make taxes feel clear, calm, and human for every person who walks through my (virtual or physical) door.</p>

    <p>I believe tax preparation should never feel intimidating or judgmental. Whether you’re filing your first return, navigating self‑employment, or managing a small business, you deserve support that meets you where you are — with patience, clarity, and respect.</p>

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>My work blends technical expertise with a warm, accessible teaching style. I specialize in helping:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Neurodiverse individuals who need pacing, structure, and clarity</li>
      <li>First‑time filers who want to understand the process</li>
      <li>Self‑employed and gig workers navigating complex rules</li>
      <li>Small business owners seeking confidence and organization</li>
      <li>Anyone who has ever felt overwhelmed, ashamed, or confused by taxes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I believe that understanding your taxes is empowering — and that everyone deserves a safe, judgment‑free space to learn.</p>

    <h2>Professional Background</h2>
    <p>I am licensed by the Oregon Board of Tax Practitioners (LTC#1922362‑C) and operate as an IRS Electronic Return Originator (ERO). I stay current on federal and state tax law, compliance requirements, and best practices to ensure every return is prepared with accuracy and care.</p>

    <h2>Beyond the Numbers</h2>
    <p>Outside of tax season, I’m a creative educator, public speaker, and advocate for financial literacy. I’m also the author of <em>Slice by Slice: Growing Up With Taxes</em>, a book designed to help young people understand money and taxes through storytelling, humor, and real‑life lessons.</p>

    <p>Whether I’m preparing a return, teaching a workshop, or helping someone untangle a confusing IRS letter, my goal is always the same: to make the process feel lighter, clearer, and more manageable.</p>

    <h2>Let’s Connect</h2>
    <p>If you’d like to learn more, book an appointment, or explore how I can support you, I’d love to hear from you.</p>
