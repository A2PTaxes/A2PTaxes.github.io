    <h1>Client Onboarding</h1>
    <p>Welcome! Whether you’re filing taxes, starting a business, or seeking guidance, this page will walk you through what to expect and how to prepare. My goal is to make the process clear, calm, and accessible for every client.</p>

    <h2>How Appointments Work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Appointments are mobile, virtual, or in-person depending on your needs.</li>
      <li>Sessions are paced to match your processing style — slower pacing is always welcome.</li>
      <li>Most appointments last 45–60 minutes, with a minimum of two appointments per return... but complex returns may require more interaction than that.</li>
      <li>You’ll receive a summary of next steps after each appointment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Response Time Expectations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Messages are answered within 2 business days.</li>
      <li>During peak tax season, response times may be slightly longer.</li>
      <li>Portal messages are prioritized over email for security reasons.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What to Bring</h2>
    <p>Here’s a general list of documents that may apply to your situation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Two forms of ID, one of which should be a government‑issued photo ID</li>
      <li>Social Security cards for all individuals on the return</li>
      <li>Last return you filed</li>
      <li>W‑2s, 1099s, and income statements</li>
      <li>1098 forms (mortgage interest, tuition, etc.)</li>
      <li>Business income and expense records</li>
      <li>Childcare provider information</li>
      <li>Health insurance forms (1095‑A, if applicable)</li>
      <li>Any IRS or state letters you’ve received</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you’re unsure what applies to you, don’t worry — we’ll go over it together.</p>

    <h2>Secure Portal Access</h2>
    <p>All tax documents must be uploaded through the secure <strong>MyTaxOffice</strong> portal. After your first appointment or inquiry, you’ll receive a portal link with instructions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not email tax documents or sensitive information.</li>
      <li>You can upload photos if you don’t have a scanner.</li>
      <li>If you need help using the portal, I’m happy to walk you through it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prior‑Year Returns & POA</h2>
    <p>If you need help with a prior‑year return and no longer have your documents:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You will first attempt to retrieve transcripts through IRS.gov and/or your state Revenue Department.</li>
      <li>If you are unable to access them, I can request them on your behalf using a Power of Attorney (POA).</li>
      <li>POA is used only as a last resort and only with your explicit consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Accessibility & Accommodations</h2>
    <p>I welcome clients of all backgrounds, abilities, genders, faiths, and processing styles. If you need accommodations — such as slower pacing, written summaries, visual aids, or alternative meeting locations — please let me know. I’m happy to adjust.</p>

    <h2>After Your Appointment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You’ll receive a summary of next steps.</li>
      <li>You’ll be notified when your return is ready for review and signature.</li>
      <li>Once signed, your return will be e‑filed and you’ll receive confirmation.</li>
    </ul>
