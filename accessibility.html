    <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>

    <p>Ames 2 Please Taxes is committed to providing an inclusive, accessible experience for every client. We understand that financial tasks can feel overwhelming, especially for individuals and families with neurodiverse needs, anxiety, or executive functioning challenges.</p>

    <p>If you need accommodations — such as slower pacing, written summaries, visual aids, alternative meeting locations, or additional time — please let us know. We are happy to adjust our approach.</p>

    <p>Please note that slower pacing or additional processing time may extend the overall length of your appointment, whether in a single session or across multiple shorter sessions.</p>

    <p>If you encounter any accessibility barriers, please reach out so we can address them.</p>
